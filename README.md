# ***Houseki No Kuni* / Land of the Lustrous**
### One of my favorite series that is really good in both mediums,
> In a mysterious future timeline, a new life form called Gems inhabit the earth. The Gems must fight back against the life forms that come from the moon called *Lunarians* who seek to turn the Gems into decorations. All Gems are assigned a specific role to play in their community, such as fighter, medic, weapon-smith, etc. One gem named Phosphophyllite, or *Phos*, is a Gem who is given no assignment due to their[^1] lack of any skills until the leader of the Gems, *Kongo*, asks them to make a natural history encyclopedia. *Phos* attempts to find a more exciting job than their currently assigned one, but ends up getting in over their head.

### Some of my favorite characters:
1. **Rutile**

> *One of the Gems and mainly works as a doctor. They[^1] repair the cracked or broken Gems and also handle the management of herbs, pastes, powders, and other medical remedies.*

2. **Yellow Diamond**

> *Often called simply Yellow, is one of the Gems who mainly participate in patrol duty. They[^1] are everyone's elder and one of the fastest gem.*

3. **Phosphophyllite or *Phos***

> *The main protagonist and the youngest Gem when the story began. They're[^1] weak, brittle - not suited for battle - and their clumsiness makes them difficult to maintain any other roles. Phos has always wanted to be useful.*

[^1]: They are all genderless, but the Gems all use explicitly male pronouns in the Japanese script to talk about each other.  For them it doesn't matter.
